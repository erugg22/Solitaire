Welcome to Solitaire! This version of the game is Klondike Solitaire. I coded this game in Java for my final AP
Computer Science project.

--Running the Game--

To run the game, run the Solitaire_Game class located in the src folder. After a moment, a screen should appear where
you can click on a 'play' or 'instructions' button.

--Development of the Game--

It took me approximately two weeks to create this game. The first week I dedicated to planning out all of the classes
with their instance variables and methods and how each class would interact each other. I got a lot of use out of the
whiteboard in my basement!
The second week was dedicated to implementation. After coding the deeper functionality of the game (operations and
transactions between arrays), I taught myself how to build a GUI (as it was not taught to us in the class) and after
some research, decided to use Java Swing for this.

--Brief Demonstration--

--Future Steps--

I would like to refine my code by cleaning up some of the object instantiations that occur within classes. I'd also
like to modify Solitaire_Game.java such that an unlimited amount of restarts are possible. I was having trouble with
this before as I am not well-versed in action listeners, but I hope to change that. I aim to implement these changes
in December of 2020.
